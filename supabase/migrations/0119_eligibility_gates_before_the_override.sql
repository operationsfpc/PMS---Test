-- 0119 — The eligibility gates the override could not be trusted to respect
--
-- `enforce_application_gates` (0041, last restated in 0056) checked the drive's
-- status, the window, the SRF, participation, campus targeting and the 10th/12th
-- bars, and then:
--
--     if d.open_to_all_override then return new; end if;
--
-- Everything BELOW that line was the ladder and the preferences, which R5a says
-- the override exists to bypass. Everything the company actually asked for —
-- `min_overall_cgpa`, `arrears_policy`, `drive_eligible_degrees`,
-- `drive_eligible_branches` — was never checked at apply time AT ALL, for any
-- student, override or not. Those four rules existed in one place only:
-- `evaluateEligibility` in the browser. A crafted POST went straight through.
--
-- So the answer to "should an open-to-all drive reach a student who fails the
-- criteria?" (2026-10-15) is: on screen no, in the database yes. The publish
-- screen counts an audience with those rules applied, ticked or not, and the
-- database then admitted people outside it. Worse, on a prestige drive the
-- override made the hole total, because it returned before any of it.
--
-- This moves all four gates ABOVE the short-circuit, which is where the domain
-- already has them (src/domain/visibility.ts: eligibility, then the override).
-- `drives_student_read` stays coarse on purpose — what a student may LIST is not
-- what a student may WIN, and a read policy that returns fewer rows is a
-- support ticket, not a safeguard. The apply gate is the one that has to be
-- right.
--
-- Arrears and CGPA are judged on the LATEST VERIFIED semester, not on what the
-- student typed last (§7.2, src/domain/academics.ts) — an unchecked number cannot
-- decide whether somebody may apply, and the semester rows a student writes
-- themselves arrive `pending`. Until a coordinator verifies any line, the figures
-- the coordinator imported for the roster stand in, exactly as the browser does:
-- locking out a cohort nobody has checked yet is a worse answer than judging it
-- on the number the college gave us.
--
-- Mirrors src/domain/eligibility.ts and src/domain/academics.ts; change both or
-- neither. The full function is restated because CREATE OR REPLACE cannot patch
-- a body. Tests: src/db/apply-guard.test.ts.
